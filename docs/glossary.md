# Project Glossary

*This glossary defines project-specific terms and concepts. Update this file as the project evolves to maintain consistent terminology across all documentation and code.*

## How to Use This Glossary

**Format**: **Term** - Clear definition with disambiguation where needed  
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent terminology across documentation, code, and communication  
**Maintenance**: Update regularly as new concepts are introduced or definitions evolve

## Core Architecture Terms

**API** - Application Programming Interface; the contract between different software components defining how they communicate and exchange data

**Component** - A reusable, self-contained piece of user interface or functionality that can be composed with other components to build larger features

**Environment** - A distinct deployment context (development, staging, production) with its own configuration, data, and access controls

**Framework** - A structured foundation that provides common functionality and patterns, allowing developers to build applications more efficiently

**Middleware** - Software that acts as a bridge between different applications or services, often handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, or data transformation

**Monorepo** - A repository structure that contains multiple related projects or packages in a single version-controlled codebase

**Service** - A standalone application or module that provides specific functionality and can communicate with other services through well-defined interfaces

---

## Development Process Terms

**Build** - The process of transforming source code into executable artifacts, including compilation, bundling, and optimization

**CI/CD** - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment; automated processes for testing, building, and deploying code changes

**Dependency** - External code or library that a project relies on to function properly

**Migration** - A systematic process for updating data structures, schemas, or system configurations while preserving existing data

**Package** - A bundle of related code, dependencies, and metadata that can be distributed and consumed by other projects

**Pipeline** - An automated sequence of steps that code changes go through, typically including testing, building, and deployment

**Release** - A specific version of the software that is packaged and made available to users

---

## User Experience Terms

**Accessibility** - Design and development practices that ensure the product is usable by people with diverse abilities and needs

**Responsive Design** - An approach to web design that ensures optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes

**User Flow** - The path users take through the application to complete tasks or achieve goals

**User Interface (UI)** - The visual and interactive elements that users interact with directly

**User Experience (UX)** - The overall experience and satisfaction a user has when interacting with the product

---

## Technical Implementation Terms

**Authentication** - The process of verifying the identity of a user or system

**Authorization** - The process of determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform

**Cache** - A temporary storage mechanism that stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval

**Database Schema** - The structure and organization of data in a database, including tables, relationships, and constraints

**Error Handling** - Systematic approaches for detecting, managing, and recovering from errors in software

**Performance Optimization** - Techniques and practices to improve the speed, efficiency, and responsiveness of software

**State Management** - Patterns and tools for managing and updating application data and UI state

---

## Project-Specific Terms

*Add your project-specific terminology here. Examples below:*

**Chat** - The primary communication interface where users exchange messages and interact with AI features

**Context Engine** - The AI system that understands and provides relevant information based on conversation context

**Message** - A single unit of communication within a chat, containing text, media, or other content

**Reference** - A link or connection to other content, users, or external resources within the system

**Suggestion** - AI-generated recommendations or insights that enhance user conversations

---

## Business and Strategy Terms

**MVP** - Minimum Viable Product; the simplest version of a product that can be released to users to validate core assumptions

**Product-Market Fit** - The degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand and solves real user problems

**Roadmap** - A strategic plan that defines goals, priorities, and timelines for product development

**Stakeholder** - Any person or group with an interest in or influence on the project's success

**Value Proposition** - The unique benefit or value that the product provides to users or customers

---

## Quality Assurance Terms

**Acceptance Criteria** - Specific conditions that must be met for a feature or user story to be considered complete

**Integration Testing** - Testing that verifies different components or services work correctly together

**Regression Testing** - Testing to ensure that recent changes don't break existing functionality

**Test Coverage** - A measure of how much of the codebase is exercised by automated tests

**Unit Testing** - Testing individual components or functions in isolation from the rest of the system

---

## Maintenance and Operations Terms

**Deployment** - The process of releasing software to a target environment where users can access it

**Monitoring** - Systematic observation of system health, performance, and user behavior

**Rollback** - The process of reverting to a previous version of software when issues are detected

**Scaling** - Adjusting system capacity to handle increased load or user demand

**Troubleshooting** - Systematic process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems

## Template Instructions

*When adding new terms to this glossary:*

1. **Place terms in the appropriate section** - Create new sections if needed
2. **Use bold formatting** for the term being defined
3. **Keep definitions concise** but complete enough to avoid ambiguity
4. **Include context** when the same term might mean different things
5. **Cross-reference related terms** when helpful
6. **Update the index.md** if major glossary changes are made

*This template can be copied to any project and customized with project-specific terminology while maintaining the overall structure and guidance.*
