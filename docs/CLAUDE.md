## Project Context

### Documentation Structure
This project uses a standardized documentation structure:
- **01-vision/** - Strategic direction and business goals
- **02-design/** - Design philosophy and user experience
- **03-architecture/** - Technical architecture and system design
- **04-features/** - Feature specifications and requirements
- **05-ai/** - AI/ML systems and implementation
- **06-integration/** - External APIs and third-party services
- **07-deployment/** - Infrastructure and deployment processes
- **08-testing/** - Testing strategies and quality assurance
- **09-maintenance/** - Operations and troubleshooting

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation-First Approach
- **Always read existing documentation** before making changes
- **Update documentation** alongside code changes
- **Create new documentation** for new features or significant changes
- **Reference related documents** to maintain coherent knowledge structure

### 2. Consistency Standards
- **Follow established patterns** - Don't introduce new architectures without discussion
- **Use project terminology** - Refer to [glossary.md](./glossary.md) for consistent language
- **Maintain code style** - Follow project linting and formatting standards
- **Preserve existing naming conventions** - Don't rename without clear benefit

### 3. Quality Requirements
- **Write comprehensive tests** for all new functionality
- **Handle error cases gracefully** with proper logging and user feedback
- **Consider performance implications** of all changes
- **Ensure accessibility compliance** for all user-facing features
- **Validate security considerations** especially for authentication and data handling

## Essential Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Read the relevant documentation sections** starting with [01-vision/](./01-vision/)
2. **Understand the current state** by reviewing recent changes
3. **Plan your approach** considering all affected files and backward compatibility

### During Development
1. **Follow established patterns** and existing component structures
2. **Write clear, maintainable code** with comprehensive comments
3. **Test thoroughly** including edge cases and error conditions

### After Completing Work
1. **Update documentation** in the appropriate numbered directories
2. **Validate your changes** through testing and quality checks
3. **Communicate your changes** with clear commit messages

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting any work, verify:
- [ ] All affected documentation has been updated
- [ ] Code follows project standards and passes all linting
- [ ] All tests pass and new tests have been added
- [ ] Changes are backwards compatible or migration path is documented
- [ ] Error cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance and accessibility requirements have been met

## Getting Help

When you need clarification:
1. **Check existing documentation** in the relevant numbered directories
2. **Review similar implementations** in the codebase for patterns
3. **Consult the glossary** for project-specific terminology
4. **Reference architecture documents** for system design decisions
