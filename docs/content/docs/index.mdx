# Welcome to TurboKit

TurboKit is a production-ready monorepo template that combines the power of **Convex**, **Next.js**, and **AI agents** to help you build and ship real-time applications faster.

## What is TurboKit?

TurboKit is more than just a boilerplate - it's a complete development platform that provides:

- **Real-time backend** powered by Convex with database, functions, and file storage
- **Modern frontend** with Next.js 15, React 19, and a comprehensive design system
- **AI-ready** with Convex Agent component for building intelligent features
- **Production infrastructure** including authentication, testing, and deployment configs

## Who is TurboKit for?

TurboKit is perfect for:

- **Startups** wanting to move fast without sacrificing quality
- **Teams** building real-time collaborative applications
- **Developers** who want modern tooling without the setup hassle
- **AI builders** integrating LLMs and agents into their products

## Core Philosophy

### üöÄ Real-time by Default
Every data fetch is a live subscription. Changes sync instantly across all clients without polling or manual refreshes.

### üéØ Type-safe End-to-end
From database schema to React components, enjoy full TypeScript coverage with generated types.

### üì¶ Batteries Included
Authentication, payments, emails, AI agents, testing, deployment - it's all configured and ready.

### üèóÔ∏è Production Ready
Not a toy template. Built with enterprise patterns, proper error handling, and scalability in mind.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
npx create-turbokit@latest my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install
npx convex init
pnpm dev
```

## What Makes TurboKit Different?

### Convex-Native Architecture
Unlike templates that bolt on a database as an afterthought, TurboKit is built from the ground up around Convex's real-time reactive architecture.

### True Monorepo Structure
Properly organized with Turborepo, shared packages, and clear boundaries between apps and libraries.

### AI as a First-Class Citizen
The Convex Agent component is deeply integrated, not just an add-on. Build chatbots, assistants, and intelligent workflows naturally.

### Modern Developer Experience
- Hot reload everywhere (including backend functions)
- Automatic TypeScript generation
- Built-in testing utilities
- One-command deployment
