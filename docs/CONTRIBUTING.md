# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the project! This guide provides everything you need to know to contribute effectively, whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Familiarize yourself with the project by reading [01-vision/](./01-vision/) and [03-architecture/](./03-architecture/)
- Review the [glossary.md](./glossary.md) for project-specific terminology
- Set up your development environment following the setup instructions in the main README

### First-Time Contributors
1. **Start small** - Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted"
2. **Ask questions** - Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on issues or implementation approaches
3. **Read the documentation** - Spend time understanding the existing codebase and patterns
4. **Follow conventions** - Observe and match existing code style and project patterns

## Development Workflow

### 1. Before You Begin
- **Check existing issues** - Your feature or bug might already be in progress
- **Discuss major changes** - Open an issue for significant features or architectural changes
- **Read relevant documentation** - Review docs in the appropriate numbered directories
- **Set up your environment** - Ensure all dependencies are installed and tests pass

### 2. Making Changes
- **Create a descriptive branch name** - Use format like `feature/add-user-authentication` or `fix/login-validation-error`
- **Follow established patterns** - Look at existing code for guidance on structure and style
- **Write tests** - Include unit tests for new functionality and regression tests for bug fixes
- **Update documentation** - Modify relevant files in the numbered directories as needed

### 3. Testing Your Changes
- **Run the full test suite** - Ensure all existing tests still pass
- **Test manually** - Verify your changes work as expected in the development environment
- **Check for regressions** - Make sure existing functionality continues to work
- **Validate edge cases** - Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

### 4. Submitting Your Contribution
- **Write clear commit messages** - Follow the conventional commits format if established
- **Create a descriptive pull request** - Explain what you changed and why
- **Reference related issues** - Link to any issues your PR addresses
- **Be responsive to feedback** - Address code review comments promptly and thoroughly

## Code Standards

### General Principles
- **Readability over cleverness** - Write code that's easy to understand and maintain
- **Consistency** - Match existing code style and patterns throughout the project
- **Performance awareness** - Consider the performance impact of your changes
- **Security mindfulness** - Be aware of security implications, especially for user inputs

### Code Style
- **Linting and formatting** - Follow the project's automated linting and formatting rules
- **Naming conventions** - Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- **Error handling** - Implement proper error handling with informative messages
- **Comments and documentation** - Include comments for complex logic and update inline docs

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for all new functions and methods
- **Integration tests** for new features and API endpoints
- **Regression tests** for bug fixes to prevent reoccurrence
- **Accessibility tests** for user-facing changes
- **Performance tests** for performance-critical changes

## Documentation Guidelines

### When to Update Documentation
- **New features** - Create or update specifications in [04-features/](./04-features/)
- **API changes** - Update relevant documentation in [06-integration/](./06-integration/)
- **Architecture changes** - Update technical docs in [03-architecture/](./03-architecture/)
- **New terminology** - Add definitions to [glossary.md](./glossary.md)
- **Deployment changes** - Update procedures in [07-deployment/](./07-deployment/)

### Documentation Standards
- **Clear and concise** - Write for your audience, whether technical or non-technical
- **Up-to-date examples** - Ensure all code examples are current and functional
- **Proper formatting** - Use consistent markdown formatting and heading hierarchy
- **Cross-references** - Link to related documents and external resources
- **Version information** - Include version numbers for time-sensitive information
