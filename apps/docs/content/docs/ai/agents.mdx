# Agents

This guide walks through configuring AI agents for your TurboKit project.

## Convex Agent

Use the Convex Agent component to define tools and run AI-powered workflows directly in your backend.

## External Tools

Optionally, connect external assistants (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to your development workflow. Ensure environment variables and permissions are configured.
