# Convex Agent

Convex’s Agent component provides a structured way to define tools, manage conversations, and run long-lived workflows.

## Key Concepts
- Tools (Convex functions as callable actions)
- Threads and memory
- Workflows for multi-step tasks

## Next Steps
- Define tools in `packages/backend/convex/agents/`
- Create durable workflows in `packages/backend/convex/workflows/`
