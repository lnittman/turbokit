# TurboKit vs next-forge

## TurboKit strengths

- Convex-native realtime architecture
- built-in starter layouts for product UI shells
- command palette + overlay patterns prewired
- notification preferences and push token registration baseline
- abbie-first loop/pair workflow configuration

## next-forge strengths

- broader app pack matrix in some setups (marketing/docs/storybook/etc.)
- mature scaffolding for common SaaS patterns
- batteries-included conventions for general Next.js teams

## Choose TurboKit when

- realtime UX is central
- Convex is your backend default
- you want five polished starter shells immediately
- you optimize for autonomous agent implementation loops

## Choose next-forge when

- you need broader framework scaffolding breadth first
- Convex is not a core requirement
- your team prefers a more generic Next.js starter baseline
