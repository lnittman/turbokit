# TurboKit vs next-forge

Snapshot date: **February 6, 2026 (America/Detroit)**

This matrix is intentionally evidence-backed. Every row maps to one or more concrete sources.

## Comparison matrix

| Dimension | TurboKit | next-forge | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starter app surfaces | Focused app + docs template (`apps/app`, `apps/docs`) | Multi-app scaffold (`web`, `app`, `api`, `docs`, `email`, `storybook`) | [T1], [N1] |
| Backend default | Convex-native package as first-class backend (`packages/backend/convex`) | General Next.js/Turborepo starter with pluggable backend choices | [T1], [N1] |
| Layout starters | Ships five UI shells (`dashboard`, `feed`, `chat`, `kanban`, `canvas`) | No equivalent 5-layout shell set in core README feature list | [T2], [N1] |
| Realtime notifications baseline | Convex notification tables + queries/mutations/actions included | Notification capability listed, but implementation details are broader starter-level | [T3], [N1] |
| Agent/loop workflow integration | Includes `.loop.json` + `.abbie/config.json` conventions for agent loops | No equivalent agent-specific loop contract in README | [T4], [N1] |
| Ops integrations | Convex-first stack with optional add-ons | Explicit SaaS stack integrations called out (Sentry, Better Stack, Stripe, Resend, etc.) | [T1], [N1] |

## Decision framing

Choose **TurboKit** when:

- realtime Convex workflows are the default architecture
- you want opinionated starter shells to ship UI quickly
- you run autonomous/assisted implementation loops with shared agent context

Choose **next-forge** when:

- you need a broader pre-scaffolded multi-app SaaS surface area
- you want pre-wired integrations across analytics/payments/observability
- your backend architecture is not Convex-first

## Maintenance process

- **Owner**: TEMP team owner (Luke) with implementation support from active coding agents.
- **Weekly quick pass**: verify major claims still match `README`/docs changes.
- **Monthly full pass**: refresh matrix rows, update references, and bump snapshot date.
- **Trigger updates immediately**: when either template lands a major structural release.
