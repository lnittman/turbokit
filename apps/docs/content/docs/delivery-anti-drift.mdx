# Delivery Anti-Drift

This page defines the **DoD v2** contract for TEMP team execution and the recurring reconciliation loop between code, commits, TODOs, and Linear.

## Definition of Done (DoD v2)

Every TEMP issue is considered done only when all checklist items pass:

- [ ] Acceptance criteria are copied into the issue and explicitly checked in final comment.
- [ ] Code pointers are provided (`path:line` for key implementation areas).
- [ ] Validation commands are listed with outcomes (`verify`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`).
- [ ] At least one commit is linked to the issue outcome.
- [ ] Follow-up work is split into explicit new issues (no silent TODO debt).
- [ ] Issue state is moved to `Done` only after the above are true.

## New issue authoring template (TEMP)

Use this structure for all new TEMP issues:

```md
## Goal
One outcome-focused sentence.

## Scope
- In-scope change 1
- In-scope change 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Observable behavior/result 1
- [ ] Observable behavior/result 2
- [ ] Validation commands + expected outcome

## Code Pointers
- `path/to/file.ts:line`
- `path/to/other.tsx:line`

## Size
S / M / L
```

## Reconciliation workflow

Run this at least weekly, and at every sprint close:

```bash
pnpm reconcile:temp
```

Artifacts:

- `docs/reports/temp-reconciliation-latest.md` (rolling report)
- `docs/reports/temp-reconciliation-2026-02-06.md` (dated baseline snapshot)

Interpretation rules:

1. Orphan TODO/FIXME lines: create/update issues so each TODO maps to a TEMP key.
2. Orphan commits: backfill Linear comments with commit hashes, or open cleanup issues.
3. Zero-link rows for active issues: add missing commit or TODO linkage.

## Cadence and ownership

| Activity | Cadence | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reconciliation report (`pnpm reconcile:temp`) | Weekly | Active implementation agent |
| Matrix/docs verification | Weekly quick pass | TEMP maintainer |
| linear-audit + council planning pass | Sprint boundary (or bi-weekly) | TEMP maintainer + council |
| DoD compliance audit | Before marking `Done` | Issue implementer |
