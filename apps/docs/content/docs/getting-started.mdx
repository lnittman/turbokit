# Getting Started

## Install + run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Build checks

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Pick a starter layout

The authenticated home page includes a layout switcher by default.

- `dashboard` for metrics-heavy apps
- `feed` for timelines and event streams
- `chat` for AI or support interfaces
- `kanban` for task workflows
- `canvas` for spatial / whiteboard products

Selection is persisted in local storage via `starterLayoutAtom`.

## Core files

- `apps/app/src/app/(authenticated)/page.tsx` layout surface entry
- `apps/app/src/layouts/*` starter layout components
- `apps/app/src/config/turbokit.config.ts` layout options and defaults
- `packages/design/styles/globals.css` global design tokens
