# Welcome to TurboKit

TurboKit is a modern, Convex-native development platform that combines real-time data synchronization, AI-powered development tools, and enterprise-ready components into one powerful stack.

## What is TurboKit?

TurboKit provides everything you need to build production-ready real-time applications:

- **Convex-Native Backend**: Real-time database with subscriptions, functions, and file storage
- **AI Development Tools**: Convex Agent component and AI-assisted workflows
- **Modern Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, Server Components, and App Router
- **Design System**: Pre-built components from shadcn/ui, Motion Primitives, and Kibo UI
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript from database schema to React components
- **Enterprise Ready**: Authentication, payments, observability, and deployment configurations

## Why TurboKit?

### ðŸš€ Real-time by Default

Unlike traditional architectures that bolt on WebSockets as an afterthought, TurboKit is built on Convex - where real-time subscriptions are the default. Your data automatically syncs across all clients without any configuration.

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Development

TurboKit integrates with the Convex Agent component and supports AI-assisted workflows so assistants like Gemini or Claude can understand project context, help scaffold features, and automate repetitive tasks.

### ðŸ“¦ Batteries Included

Start with a complete setup including:
- Authentication (Clerk)
- Payments (Polar)
- Email (Resend)
- Analytics (PostHog)
- Monitoring (Sentry)
- File Storage (Convex)

### ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful by Default

Our design system combines the best component libraries:
- **shadcn/ui**: Accessible, customizable base components
- **Motion Primitives**: Smooth animations and interactions
- **Kibo UI**: Advanced components like Gantt charts and color pickers
