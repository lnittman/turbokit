# TurboKit Docs Template

> This is a minimal, AI-native documentation template meant to be filled by agents (Claude, GPT, etc.). It includes a clean Fumadocs setup, design system integration, and MDX component mappings.

## How To Use (Agents)

1. Audit the project to learn its features
   - Read `apps/app`, `packages/backend/convex`, and `packages/design`
   - Detect routes, API endpoints, workflows, and key components
2. Propose an IA (information architecture)
   - Draft sections in `content/docs/meta.json`
   - Keep titles concise and meaningful
3. Generate pages
   - Create MDX pages in `content/docs/**`
   - Use our MDX components: Alert, Card, Tabs, Accordion, Breadcrumb
4. Iterate with maintainers
   - Validate accuracy, link to code references, and add examples

See `AGENTS.md` in this directory for step-by-step prompts and conventions.
